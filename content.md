# Setup your GitHub Profile

## Why setup your profile?
Your GitHub profile is like a software engineering resume. This is my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/heratyian). It's important for employers, clients, teammates, etc. to know it's you. As you write and contribute code to GitHub, your contribution graph will grow.

I recommend keeping only 1 GitHub account so your contribution graph is full of green. You can create organizations to separate your repositories.

## How to update your profile
Please set a profile image and display name using your first and last name so it's easy to tag you. Here are the steps to update your 'display name' and avatar:

### 1. Navigate to your profile page.

Please sign up for GitHub and share your profile page. It should be something like this: `github.com/<username>`.

- Enter your `github.com/username` profile URL:
- github.com
  - Great job!
- any
  - Not quite. Make sure the URL looks like: `https://github.com/username`
{: .free_text #github_profile_url title="GitHub profile URL" points="1" answer="1" }


<div class="alert alert-danger mt-2">


After you submit the URL here, return to Canvas and submit the URL again in the assignment "Submit your GitHub profile URL".


An instructor will provide additional feedback on your submission there.
