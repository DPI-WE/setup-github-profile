# Setup your GitHub Profile

## Why setup your profile?
Your GitHub profile is like a software engineering resume. This is my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/heratyian). It's important for employers, clients, teammates, etc. to know it's you. As you write and contribute code to GitHub, your contribution graph will grow.

I recommend keeping only 1 GitHub account so your contribution graph is full of green. You can create organizations to separate your repositories.

## How to update your profile
Please set a profile image and display name using your first and last name so it's easy to tag you. Here are the steps to update your 'display name' and avatar:

1. Navigate to your profile page.
